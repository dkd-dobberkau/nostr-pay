# nostr-pay: Self-hosted Lightning payments authenticated with Nostr (NIP-98)

I built a small self-hosted payment stack that lets you accept Lightning payments using your Nostr key for authentication.

No accounts.
No emails.
No passwords.

If you have a Nostr keypair, you already have an identity.

## What it does

nostr-pay pairs:

* Nostr-based HTTP auth (NIP-98)
* A Go API server
* LNbits (or compatible Lightning backend)
* A React PWA frontend (installable, works well on mobile)

You log in by signing requests with your Nostr private key. The server verifies the signature. There are:

* No stored passwords
* No sessions
* No cookies
* No OAuth

Invoices are generated via LNbits and payment status updates are pushed in real time over WebSocket. The POS screen flips to a green checkmark as soon as the invoice settles.

## Why

Most payment platforms require creating yet another account before you can generate your first invoice.

If you're running a market stall, hackathon booth, or pop-up shop, that friction feels unnecessary.

Nostr already gives us a public-key identity layer. NIP-98 lets us reuse that identity to authenticate HTTP requests. That means your cryptographic key is your login.

## Stack

* Backend: Go (stdlib router), SQLite
* Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
* Reverse proxy: nginx
* Deployment: Docker Compose

Everything runs locally or on your own server:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```

Keys never leave the browser. They're stored in sessionStorage and wiped when the tab closes.

## Who it's for

* People who want to accept Lightning without custodial platforms
* Developers exploring Nostr as an auth layer
* Anyone interested in self-sovereign payment tooling

It's intentionally small. Not a full merchant suite. Just a focused bridge between Nostr identity and Lightning invoices.

Feedback welcome, especially around NIP-98 auth patterns and Lightning backend abstraction.
